/* Imagine a fleet of 3 autonomous vehicles driving on a highway in a line. Every vehicle is able to control its actuators, 
but only the first in line is able to detect obsctacles. As a result, the rest of the vehicles have to follow its behavior - 
if the leader applies throttle it notifies the second vehicle (its successor) that it should apply throttle as well. 
The same happens for situation in which leader brakes.
One limitation is that one car can pass the information about throttle or brake only to one nearest vehicle that is behind. 
Since there are few vehicles, every car has to continiue  forwarding the information until the last vehicle has been notified about the action.

// ------ TASK 1 ------
/* Create enum called "VehicleState" which has three fields: DRIVING, STOPPED and NOT_SET. */

/* Create a class called "Vehicle". It should contain 2 public pure virtual functions which don't return any value and don't take any arguments:
    - ApplyThrottle
    - ApplyBrake
   And 2 public pure virtual function which return VehicleType and VehicleState enums:
    - GetType
    - GetState
*/



// ------ TASK 5 ------
/* Each vehicle driving in a line is different and requires different amount of throttle to be applied for sustaining the same speed and 
different amount of brake pressure to stop. Additionally, as we mentioned above, every vehicle has to be aware who is its successor (the vehicle behind) 
to be able to inform it about the state change. Implement "AutonomousVehicle" class which inherits from Vehicle interface and has:
    - private member containing information about its type (type:
    VehicleType)
    - private member containing information about its state (type: VehicleState)
    - private member containing pointer to the vehicle behind (use smart pointers if you can)
    - private member containing information about the required throttle (type: integer)
    - private member containing information about the required brake pressure (type: integer)
    - public constructor taking as parameters values of:
      - vehicle type (type: VehicleType)
      - required throttle (type: integer),
      - brake pressure (type: integer),
      - pointer to the vehicle behind.
      Remember to initialize the values of all the members)
    - public copy constructor which ensures that the state and
      address of the successor are not copied (state should be
      reset to NOT_SET and pointer should be set to nullptr)
    - public assignment operator which has the same responsibility as
      the copy constructor
    - implementation of ApplyThrottle member function which prints "<VehicleType>: applying throttle = <throtle_value>", updates the state of the vehicle and makes the successor to apply throttle as well
    - implementation of ApplyBrake member function which prints "<VehicleType>: applying brake = <throtle_value>", updates the state of the vehicle and make the successor to apply brake as well
    - implementation of GetType member function
    - implementation of GetState member function
